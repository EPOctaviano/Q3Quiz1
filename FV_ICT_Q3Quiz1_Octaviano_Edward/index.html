					<td>This movie begins with the main character, Newt Scamander, arriving in New York for animal business. In the midst of the plot, Newt befriends Jacob, a no-mag, and falls in love with Tina Goldstein. The animals he keeps inside his magical suitcase escape and spread throughout New York. It's up to Jacob and Newt to find and recapture them. Newt later finds himself with his suticase and wand confiscated along with Tina. They later escape through the help of the creatures he keeps in his pockets. Credence, a soon-to-be-known wizard, goes rampant in the streets of New York and destroys many buildings which later exposes the magic community. With the help of Newt, they manage to soothe Credence, obliviate New York, and keep the magic community hidden. The movie ends with Newt leaving New York to save more endangered beasts.<br><br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3183660/"><font color="blue", size="5">More Info Here!</a></font></td>

					<td>In the second movie of Fantastic Beasts, we find the main villain, Gellert Grindelwald, escaping prison during his transfer to another. Fast forward, we find Newt, his brother, Theseus, and Leta. Newt tries to get his travel rights back but ultimately fails. Some time later within the movie, we find Dumbledore and Newt meeting up to talk about Credence and Grindelwald. Dumbledore assigns Newt to find Credence and Grindelwald but that will fail later on since Credence will have been on Grindelwald's side. Grindelwald calls his followers to meet up at a graveyard in Paris, meeting with his followers, Newt and his team, and the magic community. Grindelwald later unleashes a blue flame that should've engulfed Paris, but with the help of Newt's team, they managed to seal it back to where it came.<br><br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123430/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_8_nm_0_q_fantastic%2520beasts"><font color="blue", size="5">More Info Here!</a></font></td></td>

					<td>In the third movie of this trilogy, we find Newt tending to a Qilin who had just given birth to their child. Suddenly, Grindelwald's team of wizards kill the mother Qilin and chase after Newt in hopes to get the baby Qilin to crown Grindelwald as the new leader of magic. After finding out what happened, Dumbledore devises a plan to fail Grindelwald's plan. Grindelwald later decides to begin campaigning while his followers support him. The day of choosing arrives and Dumbledore's plan is set to begin. The fake Qilin created by Grindelwald loses its life and the real Qilin is brought out. The Qilin chooses a leader, Grindelwald disappears, and the magic community is changed forever. <br><br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123432/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_secrets%2520of%2520"><font color="blue", size="5">More Info Here!</a></font></td></td></td>
